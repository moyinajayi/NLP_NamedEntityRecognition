    "Our hope is that we can collectively turn the climate crisis into an opportunity for change. We can all help save the planet by creating and pursuing greener careers for the world’s workforce. This green transition can see existing jobs apply more green skills and new green jobs emerge in tandem.\n",

    "In my LinkedIn Learning course, Closing the Green Skills Gap to Power a Greener Economy, I’ll help you better understand the green transition and the opportunities it presents. You’ll learn more about green skills and understand the rise of green jobs. I’ll look at what different countries and sectors are doing to lead green change. I’ll also give practical advice about what you can do to embrace and take advantage of this rapid economic shift. Watch this course for free until May 19, 2022. \n",

Globally, members with green skills have been more resilient to economic downturns than the rest of the workforce. So improving or adding to your green skills is a great place to start. You could consider self-directed learning, offline or online. You could also enroll in a green-related higher education course to help you upskill.\n",

    "Nurture your network of green skilled workers\n",

    "\n",
    "Indeed our data shows that green skilled workers tend to have stronger networks, with two and sometimes three times more connections on average. Your network is the way to build new relationships, ignite conversations and find new opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "So start seeking out ‘green’ related content that interests you and consider engaging with it, for example, by commenting on it or sharing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why not join a LinkedIn Group dedicated to a green topic that you’re passionate about? And if you’re feeling more adventurous, you can even set up your own LinkedIn group, especially if you can’t find a green topic specific to your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, you’ll ignite new conversations which could present new green opportunities for not only you but also your network.\"\"\""
